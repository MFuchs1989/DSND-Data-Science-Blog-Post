## Project Overview

![CRISP-DM][image1]

In the course of this project within my Data Science Nanodegree of Udacity I wrote a post about the Data Science Process according to CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining).
I have dealt with 3 previously asked research questions (descriptive part) and have shown how a machine learning model can be developed to make predictions about house prices. 

## Research Questions

### Research Question 1
The first research question is:
Is there a difference in the characteristics of the properties, if they are located on a waterfront?

### Research Question 2
The second research question is:
What clusters are there in terms of real estate?

### Research Question 3
The third research question is:
Does the number of square meters have a significant influence on the price of the property?


## Research Questions - Answers

### Research Question 1 Answer:

The average price for waterfront properties is almost twice as high as for other properties.
In contrast, however, plots without a water front have on average more square meters of living space and usable area. Also in terms of condition and degree they are a little better off.
If one regards the year of construction of the real estates then one can state that the houses at a waterfront are average 18 years older.

### Research Question 2 Answer:
Within the data set 4 clusters could be identified. We can see in the graphic shown that the target buyer groups of the houses can be clearly defined. In this case, targeted customer segmentation and personalized recommendations from a marketing point of view would now be an option.

### Research Question 3 Answer:
The p value given to us clearly shows that the number of square meters is highly significant for the prediction of house prices.
